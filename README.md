# Problem
I created an app that is backed by firebase. Authentication as you will see is handled by firebase.
After successfull authentication I want to show the business logic of my app to the users.
For this I want to change the screen but somehow I receive and duplicate keys error right after login in.
What is the best practice for switching between authentication screens and business logic?
